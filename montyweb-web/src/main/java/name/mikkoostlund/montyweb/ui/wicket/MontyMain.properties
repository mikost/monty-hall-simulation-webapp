paragraph1.what.is.the.monty.hall.problem=The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show "Let's Make a Deal" and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975. It became famous as a question from a reader's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990\:
quote.of.readers.question.in.parade.magazine=Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors\: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
paragraph2.what.is.the.monty.hall.problem=Vos Savant's response was that the contestant should switch to the other door. Under the standard assumptions, contestants who switch have a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while contestants who stick to their choice have only a 1/3 chance.
what.can.i.do.on.this.site=How can I experiment with the Monty Hall problem on this site?
bullet.about.simulation.tab=In the "Simulation" tab, you can run simulations of the "Let's Make a Deal" show, and see for yourself what strategy yields the best chance to win the car.
